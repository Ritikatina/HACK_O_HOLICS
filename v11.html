One of them is visualization of algorithms and data structures using JavaScript. You can make a web interface for visualization of different algorithms on large data and a dynamic view of their running time. Running time will be measured and displayed simultaneously while the program is running. This will highlight the advantages and drawbacks of various algorithms in various operations.

Starting from the basic, you can make a visualization of inserting 10000 nodes in a singly linked list vs doubly linked list vs circular list. The visualization as well as time progress bar can run simultaneously to compare the operation on each data structure.</h4>

 <h4 id="A">1.If you mean mobile application then Java is good to go with. However, there's a new language kotlin which you can learn.

If you mean desktop application then I will suggest you to go with Python and QT. Java is also the option but Python is far better.

But the first and foremost thing that you need to know is neither languages matter, nor you need to start learning a language. The best way to become a developer is to start development and learn alongside. Don't mug up theories and codes. Start early.

Find out basic projects and try to code them. Search for small projects on github, run them locally and study their codes. That's the fastest and smartest way to become a developer.</h4>

<h4 id="D">4.There are less projects on Algorithms and Data Structure. Projects are made by implementing these. However, there are a couple of famous projects using these.

One of them is visualization of algorithms and data structures using JavaScript. You can make a web interface for visualization of different algorithms on large data and a dynamic view of their running time. Running time will be measured and displayed simultaneously while the program is running. This will highlight the advantages and drawbacks of various algorithms in various operations.
